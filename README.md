## Stochastic-Energy-Balance-Model

This is a Jupyter Notebook that makes part of Figure 1 in this [Journal of Climate](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/30/20/jcli-d-17-0159.1.xml) article.  This was created as a Corrigendum to the article where I had inadvertently used the wrong atmosphere damping parameter.  The figure this produces shows that the overall results do not change drastically when using a more appropriate damping parameter.
